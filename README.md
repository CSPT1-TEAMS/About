CSPT1 TEAMS
===========

Overview
--------

On Monday, March 19, 2018, LambdaSchool is implementing a new program
for the Computer Science Part Time cohort called **CSPT1 TEAMS**.  The
cohort will be divided into three teams, each led by a Project Manager.
The members of the team will be reassigned to a different team with
different members every four weeks (two major sprint iterations).

The following is a tentative overview of the new program; details are
still being worked, and it is expected that the details will change as
the program gets underway.  We value your feedback and suggestions to
refine the program into a quality learning experience.  A web page is
being developed that will have the current implementation of this
program available for consultation and feedback.  Until that page is
launched, this README will provide current information as it becomes
known.

A Slack channel will be created for discussion of this topic; each of
you will be a member, along with your Project Managers, the Instructor,
and Administration.  All questions and answers will take place in that
channel and every discussion will be available for all to take part in.

### Pair Programming

Inside teams, team members will pair program the current sprint, but
will be expected to collaborate with other team members and the Project
Manager to discuss issues and resolve blockers.  At the conclusion of
the sprint, the team members will come together for a team standup and
work together to produce one sprint that is an advanced merge of the
pairs.  The team members are expected to discuss the pros and cons of
their own production and advocate for their position or explain why
their production would not be the best choice.  The Project Manager will
facilitate the discussion, and will be the final arbiter as to what gets
included in the final production.

### One-on-One Time

During the sprint, one member will be paired with their Project Manager
and will spend that evening discussing the sprint, coding challenges,
prior sprints, and sprint challenges.  This time will be their
one-on-one with a Project Manager and will be a time to get into any
questions or problems that exist, and to get some experience presenting
a coding challenge in front of someone, a vital skill to develop that is
considerably different than working on a coding challenge by oneself.
The member teamed with the Project Manage will change every evening.
Since there will be approximately eighteen members, each member will be
assigned to pair with a Project Manager about once every two weeks.

### Saturdays

#### Sprint Challenge

Every other Saturday will be a full sprint challenge.   This wil remain
an individual project for each student.  Each student must present their
solution at the conclusion of the challenge as a pull request.

#### Presentations

1. Brown Bag

The alternating Saturday will consist of a Brown Bag presentation by
both students and Project Managers.  This should last about 30 minutes,
give or take.

2. Sprint Challenge Solution

Next, there will be a solution given to the sprint challenge of the past
week.

## Personal Github Repos

To place any Team repo into your Personal Github repo:

1. Create a _New Repository_ in your Personal Github (look for the Plus
   sign with  a dropdown  next to your  icon on the  top menu  bar, far
   right side).

2. Give the new repo a _Repository Name_ in the blank box.  Add a
   description of your choice (optional).
   
3. You can add your own README and .gitconfig if you want

To place any Team repo into your Personal Github repo:

1. Create  a _New Repository_  in your  Personal Github (look  for the
   Plus sign with  a dropdown next to  your icon on the  top menu bar,
   far right side).

2. Give  the new  repo a _Repository  Name_ in the  blank box.   Add a
   description of your choice (optional).
   
3. You can add your own README and .gitconfig if you want, or if there
   is already one, just leave those alone.
   
4. Hit the button to **Create repository**.

5.  At the  top there  will be  a _Quick  setup_ ---  copy the  URL by
   clicking on the _paste_ button at the far right.
   
6. In your  terminal, navigate to the  top level of the  Team repo you
   will be  saving on Github, and  then type `git remote  add personal
   <paste URL here>`.  It is vital that you are in the right directory
   when you  do this  command.  You  should not  be in  the enveloping
   _CSPT1_TEAMS_  directory,  but  rather  in the  top  level  of  the
   _Insta-Clone-React_ directory,  for example,  if that were  the one
   you were going to be saving.

7. To  easily get your  branch, type `git  branch`, then copy  the one
   that is starred.
   
8. Lastly, type `git push personal <paste branch here>`

You  should now  have a  personal copy  of your  Team project  on your
personal Github page.
